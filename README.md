64 'ants' reprogram one another. The world they crawl on and change is simultaneously the encoding of their simple AI. 

Each row of bool values represents the mind of a single ant.

Each neighborhood configuration results in 2-bits that determine the ant's next movement. The nieghborhood is the ant's current position and the four positions to the right.

All ants always mutate the territory they cross.
